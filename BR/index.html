        <p class="text">Welcome to the party!!! Now, I've never been to Brazil, I know for certain that I will be there in the next few years if I can help it. This is because one of my best friends, and current roommate is from there. From what Ive heard, this country is a cultural gem. From the food, the music, and people, I would say its at the top of my list for places I need to go. Since being in close proximity with a Brazilian for a couple years now, I have taken a liking to a lot of the music including Baile Funk and Bossa Nova.</p>
