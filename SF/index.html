        <p class="text">I moved out to California, specifically San Francisco, for my Sophomore year of college. I was very nervous at the time but now after living here for a couple years I realize that this city is extremely special to me even if I do not settle down here. The drastic increase of sun compared to Pennsylvania made it a lot easier to adapt to. Avoiding feet of snow every year is another bonus. Some of my favorite things I discovered out here were quality wine, and Pho.</p>
