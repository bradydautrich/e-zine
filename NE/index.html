        <p class="text">The north east US has a very unique culture compared to the rest of the country in my opinion. This culture is one that is comfortable to me. Growing up in the NYC sphere of influence, as well as my mom's family being from the city and surrounding suburbs, I grew up with a lot of the same foods and mentality that NY is known for. In general, the North East has a culture that can be abrasive to some. A lot of people think East Coasters are rude people, but in reality I think they are just extremely to the point as it does not waste time. I think they actually have really big hearts. The things I miss the most are the real pizza and Dunkin.</p>
