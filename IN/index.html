        <p class="text">Since April 2023 India has been the country with the biggest population, surpassing China. When you think about what these 1.4 billion people are eating, what do you think of? I think about all of the dishes that comprise of the GOLD of the world's food. The best dishes the world has to offer resides here in my opinion. It makes sense the British wanted to be here for so long because their food is LACKING. I hope to get to visit India one day since one of my best friends is from here, specifically Kashmir. Which has the mountains like the alps but with the best food in the world.</p>
