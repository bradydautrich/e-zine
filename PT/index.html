        <p class="text">While as of making this I've never been to Europe, a few weeks from now I will be living in Lisbon for a couple months. I am not very familiar with Portugal but since I will be there in the summer, I am pretty sure it will be great weather. I have also heard they have great wine there so I look forward to that. I also have a natural love for canned fish and Portugal is known for their sardines so I am excited to get to try theirs. I also know about their lemons because at the farmers market they are always labeled "Lisbon" Lemons so I will have to see what that is all about.</p>
