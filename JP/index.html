        <p class="text">While Ive never been to Japan this is also one of my top countries I want to visit. It holds a special place to me since my girlfriend was raised here for a good chunk of her childhood. I also love a lot of the food since I love fish. I would like to be able to go here in person so I can taste proper matcha and go to a conveyer belt sushi restaurant and buy then watch a robot make my hot coffee from a vending machine.</p>
